# SMB-Sparsification
A repo to contain all the code for my Stochastic Block Model Sparsification Papers. I am interested in the question of how much can various types of stocastic block models be sparsified, while allowing for the recovery of the communities? Also, how error in the eigensolver can be tolerated while still recovering the communities? My first paper on the topic is available here if you'd like to read more.

This repo contains my matlab code, in an unorganized manner. Maybe on day I'll clean it up!
